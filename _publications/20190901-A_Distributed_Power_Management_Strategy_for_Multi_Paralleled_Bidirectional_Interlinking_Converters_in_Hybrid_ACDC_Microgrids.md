excerpt: 'For a hybrid ac/dc microgrid (MG), bidirectional interlinking converters (BICs) enable flexible power interactions between ac and dc subgrids. In each subgrid, power sharing among diversified sources has been effectively realized by droop controllers. These power sharing concepts can also be extended to BIC applications. This paper proposes a distributed power management strategy (DPMS) for multi-paralleled BICs in the hybrid MG to avoid the overstress of a single BIC. In this strategy, each BIC is assigned with a well-devised localized distributed controller (LDC) which generates the respective power reference for the BIC. By using the LDC, BICs are allowed to exchange information with one another in the distributed communication graph. The power interactions between ac and dc subgrids can be proportionally allocated to BICs based on their different power ratings in a full distributed manner. Then the system reliability and scalability are significantly improved. Meanwhile, accurate global power sharing among all ac and dc sources in the MG would be accordingly attained. Considering the communication time delay involved in BICs, a small signal model is derived to predict the maximum tolerable delay of the studied system. The validities of the proposed DPMS and delay stability analyses are verified by a controller hardware-in-loop experimental platform.'
