title: "Power Lever: To Transform Interlinking Architecture in Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids Community"

collection: publications

category: manuscripts

excerpt: 'Microgrids (MGs) have shown considerable momentum in ongoing energy transition in global context. However, as the MGs progressively evolve into the configuration of MGs community, power congestion as well as complex power flow distribution inside hybrid ac/dc MGs community inevitably compromise efficient holistic system operations. Conventional approaches rely on interlinking converters to regulate power flow, but these systems operate under fully rated power schemes, leading to low efficiency and high cost. This article proposes a novel energy storage (ES)-based power lever (ES-PL), intending to transform the interlinking architecture of hybrid ac/dc MGs community. ES-PL is derived from a partial rated power scheme which gives rise to less power loss and saves system capital cost. By means of ES-PL, an interplexed global power sharing scheme is proposed to manipulate the power flow within the hybrid system such that entire system loads can be proportionally shared by all MGs. A complete dynamic model is carefully established, and the guidelines of key control parameter selection are presented based on comprehensive small signal stability analyses. The effectiveness of proposed ES-PL as well as its corresponding control strategy are verified by hardware experimentation.'
