excerpt: 'The high penetration of renewable energy sources in future power grids presents stability challenges for grid-connected inverters, particularly during large frequency drops under a wide range of short-circuit ratio (SCR) and X/R conditions. To address these challenges, especially for applications requiring firm power delivery such as utility-scale renewable plants under power purchase agreements, this paper proposes a tight grid-forming (TGFM) control framework. The primary objective of TGFM is to ensure precise and robust tracking of active power references, shifting the focus from passive frequency support to active and reliable power injection during grid disturbances. The proposed framework employs a grid voltage state observer to achieve real-time, high-fidelity estimation of the grid voltage phase and frequency across diverse line impedance conditions. By integrating this real-time grid information into the controller, the inverter dynamically compensates for grid phase variations. This ensures a stable power angle, enabling the inverter to tightly track its power command and thereby preventing the overcurrent and oscillatory instabilities common during large frequency drops. The effectiveness of the proposed TGFM strategy is validated through comprehensive simulations and physical experiments under various grid conditions, demonstrating superior power tracking performance and stability.'
