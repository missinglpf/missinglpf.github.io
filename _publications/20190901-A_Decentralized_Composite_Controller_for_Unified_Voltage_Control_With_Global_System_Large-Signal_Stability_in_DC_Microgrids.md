title: "A Decentralized Composite Controller for Unified Voltage Control With Global System Large-Signal Stability in DC Microgrids"

collection: publications

category: manuscripts

excerpt: 'Bus voltage control is an essential issue in a DC microgrid (MG). In this paper, a decentralized composite controller (DCC) is proposed to unify two types of voltage controls, i.e., constant voltage mode and droop mode, and simultaneously realize global system large-signal stability of the MG. The main idea of the DCC is to partition the MG into dispatchable unit (DU) subsystems and the lumped load. A well-devised high gain observer is adopted to estimate the electrical coupling of a particular DU subsystem with other DUs and the load. Then, rather than dealing with the MG as a whole, the DCC is locally designed to offset the estimated coupling and stabilize the internal states of the DU subsystem. By doing so, each subsystem can be virtually decoupled from the MG and functions in an isolated fashion. When DU subsystems are interlinked, large-signal stabilization of the entire MG would be obtained by only guaranteeing the localized stability of individual subsystems. This stabilizing strategy has not been reported in the literature thus far. Relevant theoretical analyses are rigorously conducted by employing Lyapunov stability theorem. The effectiveness of the DCC has been verified by simulations. Experimentations show that the DCC enables faster system performance recovery and provides wider stability margin than the conventional PI controller.'
