Last Saturday local time, a large-scale power outage occurred in San Francisco, United States. Triggered by an unexpected failure at a power substation, electricity supply was disrupted across multiple areas of the city, affecting approximately 130,000 residential and commercial customers. The incident coincided with a weekend and the peak holiday shopping period, leading to widespread disruption in urban transportation, public services, and certain technology-dependent applications.

By the following day, electricity had been gradually restored in most affected areas. Nevertheless, the outage sparked sustained public and media attention regarding the safety of urban infrastructure and the city’s emergency response capacity.

### Timeline of Events

Saturday, December 21 – Morning (around 11:30 a.m.): An abnormal incident occurred at a power facility in downtown San Francisco, followed by sudden power outages across multiple districts. Around noon, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) confirmed that a fire had broken out at a substation, which was identified as the direct cause of the outage. Power supply to the affected areas was immediately shut down as a safety measure.

Saturday, December 21 – Afternoon: The scope of the outage expanded rapidly, eventually affecting roughly one-third of the city. Residential neighborhoods, commercial districts, and public facilities experienced service disruptions. Urban transportation was significantly impacted: traffic signals at numerous intersections failed, prompting police officers to manually direct traffic at key locations. Several public transit routes experienced delays or temporary suspensions.Notably, due to the failure of traffic signal systems, some autonomous taxis came to a halt at intersections, resulting in short-term traffic congestion. Images and videos of these incidents circulated widely on social media, drawing public attention.

Saturday, December 21 – Night: Repair efforts continued overnight. PG&E stated that maintenance crews were working continuously on equipment repairs and network reconfiguration, prioritizing the restoration of power to hospitals and public safety facilities. The city government issued safety advisories, with San Francisco’s Department of Emergency Management urging residents to limit nighttime travel and exercise caution at intersections without functioning traffic signals.

Sunday, December 22: Electricity was progressively restored across the city. While most affected areas regained power, tens of thousands of customers continued to experience intermittent outages or awaited full restoration. PG&E announced that complete restoration was expected by Monday and that a comprehensive investigation into the cause of the incident would be conducted.

### Assessment of Impacts

Livelihoods and Commercial Activities: Many businesses were forced to close earlier than planned. Electronic payment systems, refrigeration equipment, and security systems were disrupted. Daily life for residents was affected, with some communities experiencing temporary interruptions in communication and lighting.

Urban Operations: The transportation system faced significant strain, requiring substantial deployment of police and emergency resources. Municipal offices, libraries, and public service counters were temporarily closed or operated on delayed schedules.

Technology and Governance Issues: The outage raised questions about the resilience of autonomous driving systems under power-loss scenarios and once again highlighted the city’s heavy reliance on centralized energy supply and digital infrastructure.

### Observations and Broader Implications

In its official statement, PG&E described the incident as a chain reaction triggered by an unexpected equipment failure and confirmed that no casualties were reported. Although the outage was brought under control within a relatively short period, it exposed several structural vulnerabilities:

Systemic risks associated with aging power infrastructure

The high dependency of technologically advanced cities on stable energy supply

The fragility of intelligent transportation and automated systems under sudden power disruptions

Such incidents may serve as a critical catalyst for advancing power grid modernization, promoting distributed energy systems, and strengthening urban emergency governance and resilience planning.
